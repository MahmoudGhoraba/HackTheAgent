## ❓ IF JUDGES ASK

**Q: Why only 14-15/20?**
- "See SUBMISSION.md scoring section - core pipeline works great, some features not fully integrated yet"

**Q: Can you get to 17+?**
- "Yes, with 4 hours: connect threat detection, link database, complete Gmail flow"

**Q: What's not working?**
- "See HONEST_AUDIT.md - threat detection UI not connected, SQLite not used, IBM Orchestrate not called"

**Q: Why not fix it before submitting?**
- "Better to be honest about current state than rush integration that might break things"

**Q: Is this production-ready?**
- "MVP yes - tested locally. Production needs PostgreSQL, tests, monitoring, hardening"

**Q: How can I test it?**
- "Follow README.md - backend and frontend ready to run. Try demo at localhost:3000"
